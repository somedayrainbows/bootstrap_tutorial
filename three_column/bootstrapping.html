  <div class="col-md-4">  <h2>Seinfeld Says I</h2>
    <p>George: No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section. George: When you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Jerry: Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli even if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce? Elaine: There's nothing more sophisticated than diddling the maid and then chewing some gum. , Kramer: These pretzels are making me thirsty. George: I have a bad feeling that whenever a lesbian looks at me they think 'That's why I'm not a heterosexual.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-4">  <h2>Seinfeld Says II</h2>
    <p>Jerry: Men don't care what's on TV. They only care what else is on TV. Mr. Peterman: None other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate. Jerry: Introducing 'Lite'. The new way to spell 'Light' but with twenty percent fewer letters. Kramer: Moles -- Freckle's ugly cousin. Elaine (looking out Jerry's window): Do you ever spit on anybody from here.</p></div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Seinfeld Says III</h2>
  <p>Newman: I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes: they're meaningless. Elaine: Snapple? Babu's Brother: No, too fruity. Elaine: Is this going to hurt? Doctor: Yes, very much. Kramer: You don't eat Oreos? The way you break 'em open and.... It's like you're having sex with 'em. Kramer: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone!; Kramer: Retail is for suckers. Jerry: Why do I always have the feeling everyone's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoon.</p></div>
